# `near-api-js` documentation

Docs for this project are generated with an external generator:

[https://github.com/near/near-api-js-docs-generator](https://github.com/near/near-api-js-docs-generator)

A GitHub [action](../.github/workflows/docs.yml) is triggered upon every `near-api-js` release.

The build script ([./build.sh](./build.sh)):
1. Clones the generator
2. Builds the docs with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/)

Then the Action publishes the generated site to GitHub Pages: [https://near.github.io/near-api-js/](https://near.github.io/near-api-js/)
