# `near-api-js` documentation

Docs for this project are generated with an external generator:

[https://github.com/near/docs-generator](https://github.com/near/docs-generator)

- A GitHub [workflow](../.github/workflows/docs-generator.yml) is triggered upon every `near-api-js` release.
- It invokes a lister on a GitHub App installed on @near/docs (deployed on Vercel).
