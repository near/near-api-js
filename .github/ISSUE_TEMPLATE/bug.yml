        Before filing your issue, ask yourself:
        - Is this clearly a NEAR JavaScript API defect?
        - Do I have basic ideas about where it goes wrong? (For example, if there are stack traces, are they pointing to one file?)

        **Please don't use issues for just questions**. For support please use our other channels - the [Discord server](https://near.chat) or [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/near/near-api-js/discussions).
        
        The quickest way to verify whether it's a NEAR JavaScript API defect is through a **reproduction**, starting with a fresh project and making changes until the bug is reproduced.
