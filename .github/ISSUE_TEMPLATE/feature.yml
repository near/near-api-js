        Important things:

        - This is for feature request including a real API design, not just a basic idea.
        - The design does not have to be perfect, we'll discuss it if needed.
        - For a more "casual" feature request, consider using GitHub Discussions instead: https://github.com/near/near-api-js/discussions/categories/ideas
