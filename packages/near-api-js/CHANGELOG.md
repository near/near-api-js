## 6.0.0

### Major Changes

Packages are now truly independent and can be imported separately. We strongly encourage users to use the modularized packages instead of the monolithic `near-api-js` package.

- `Account` has received major changes to its interface, we recommend reading the `CHANGELOG` for the `@near-js/accounts` package

- `Signer` class has received major changes to its interface, we recommend reading the `CHANGELOG` for the `@near-js/signers` package

- `Connection` has been deprecated, as it is no longer used by the `Account` class

- A new package `@near-js/tokens` has been added, which allows to work with tokens on the NEAR blockchain. This includes the Native NEAR, Fungible Tokens and Non-Fungible Tokens.

  Users that were doing

  new WalletConnection(near, "undefined");
  ```

  If they want to access the keys they had potentially accumulated

  -  { account_id: 'example.near' }
  -);

WIth this changes both `JsonRpcProvider.query` and `JsonRpcProvider.sendJsonRpc` methods will return proper error type for these errors: `AccountDoesNotExist`, `AccessKeyDoesNotExist`, `CodeDoesNotExist`, `InvalidNonce`.

  An additional fix to `getErrorTypeFromErrorMessage` function. Now `getErrorTypeFromErrorMessage` will not change error type if it already exists.
