- [#1014](https://github.com/near/near-api-js/pull/1014) [`8feb1997`](https://github.com/near/near-api-js/commit/8feb199733a770b25b63b0bbc7d79fc8b0b1683c) Thanks [@esaminu](https://github.com/esaminu)! - Make `appKeyPrefix` a required arg to `WalletConnection` constructor

  Users that were doing

  ```typescript
  new WalletConnection(near);
  ```

  will now have to do

  new WalletConnection(near, "undefined");
  ```

  If they want to access the keys they had potentially accumulated

  -  'wrap.near',
  -  'storage_balance_of',
  -  { account_id: 'example.near' }
  -);
  +await account.viewFunction({
  +  contractId: 'wrap.near',
  +  methodName: 'storage_balance_of',
  +  args: { account_id: 'example.near' },
  +});
  ```

WIth this changes both `JsonRpcProvider.query` and `JsonRpcProvider.sendJsonRpc` methods will return proper error type for these errors: `AccountDoesNotExist`, `AccessKeyDoesNotExist`, `CodeDoesNotExist`, `InvalidNonce`.

  An additional fix to `getErrorTypeFromErrorMessage` function. Now `getErrorTypeFromErrorMessage` will not change error type if it already exists.
